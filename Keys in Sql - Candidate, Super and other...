Assume table:

Student(
    RollNo,
    Email,
    Aadhaar,
    Name,
    Phone
)

🔑 1️⃣ Super Key

Super Key is any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row.

Example:
RollNo ✅
Email ✅
Aadhaar ✅
(RollNo + Name) ✅
(Email + Phone) ✅
Even extra columns add kar do — still unique hai.

👉 Means: Unique identify kare = Super Key.

-----------------------

🎯 2️⃣ Candidate Key

Candidate Key is a minimal super key.

Minimal matlab:  Extra unnecessary column nahi hona chahiye.

Example:

RollNo ✅
Email ✅
Aadhaar ✅
But:
(RollNo + Name) ❌
Because RollNo alone enough hai.

👉 Candidate key = smallest unique key.

-----------------------

🔄 3️⃣ Alternate Key

Alternate Key is candidate key that is not chosen as primary key.

Example:

Agar Primary Key choose kiya:

-> RollNo

To:
Email
Aadhaar
 # become Alternate Keys.

-----------------------
🌿 4️⃣ Natural Key

Natural Key is a key that has real-world meaning.

Example:

Aadhaar number
Email
Passport number

Ye naturally exist karte hain.

-----------------------

🤖 5️⃣ Surrogate Key

Surrogate Key is an artificial key created by system.

Example:

Auto-increment ID
UUID

System-generated primary key

Example:
StudentID (Auto Increment)

# Ye real-world se related nahi hota.

Surrogate Key	  Artificial system-generated key	      Auto ID


A super key is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row. A candidate key is a minimal super key with no unnecessary attributes.
Among candidate keys, the one selected as primary key is called the primary key, and the remaining are alternate keys.
A natural key is a real-world meaningful attribute used for identification, while a surrogate key is a system-generated artificial key used when natural keys are not
suitable.
